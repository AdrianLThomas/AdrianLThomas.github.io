title: Running Postgres in the browser with PGlite and Drizzle

---

I've been playing around with [PGlite](https://pglite.dev/) ([Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)), and it's pretty cool - you can run Postgres 100% in the browser client. There are some gotchas, so I'll run through how I got PGlite running with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) (React) and [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (ORM).

# Getting setup

Run the Vite scaffolder with your favourite package manager (I'll continue to use Bun, but feel free to use your own flavour)
```bash
bun create vite
```
and follow the steps to create a new React project.

You can then add PGlite:
```bash
bun add @electric-sql/pglite
```

## Gotcha #1 - Exclude PGlite from the bundle
Some bundlers (like Vite and Next.js) struggle with PGlite, so we need to [exclude it from the Vite](https://pglite.dev/docs/bundler-support#vite) bundle, otherwise it will error.
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  optimizeDeps: {
    exclude: ["@electric-sql/pglite"],
  },
});
```

## PGlite 101
We're now in a position to make a Postgres query!

```tsx
/// App.tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

import { PGlite } from "@electric-sql/pglite";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/pglite";

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const client = new PGlite("idb://my-pgdata");
    const db = drizzle({ client });

    db.execute(
      `select 1;`
    ).then((sql) => console.log({ sql }));
  });

  return (
    <p>Markup omitted for brevity...</p>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We're using `idb://my-pgdata` when instantiating the client to use persistent browser storage. However there are also [other storage options](https://pglite.dev/docs/filesystems#filesystems) available.

## Types, schema & migrations with Drizzle 
You can probably skip this part if you don't want / need to use an ORM and are happy with arbritrary SQL. However if you'd like types and the ability to migrate between schemas, please continue...

```bash
bun add drizzle-orm # Let's us define the schema and gives us types
bun add -d drizzle-kit # Helpful for migrations
```

You can then [create a schema with Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration). For this example let's just create a simple TODO app:

```typescript
/// src/app/db/schema.ts

import {
    pgTable,
    serial,
    varchar,
    boolean,
    timestamp,
  } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
  
  export const todos = pgTable("todos", {
    id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
    content: varchar("content", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    completed: boolean("completed").default(false),
    createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
  });
```

Drizzle will provide us with some nice types based on this.

## Gotcha #2 - How do you run migrations in the browser?
The [PGlite / Drizzle get started guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/pglite-new) is great, but it assumes you're running PGlite on the server. Thus there are some differences (and unfortunately an undocumented API we need to use..).

Create a Drizzle config file:
```typescript
import type { Config } from "drizzle-kit";

export default {
  schema: "./src/app/db/schema.ts",
  out: "./src/app/db/migrations",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  driver: "pglite",
} satisfies Config;
```

Generate the migration:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate # generates the SQL files to perform a migration
```

Ordinarily you would now run `npx drizzle-kit migrate`, HOWEVER: you're not on the server, you're on the client! so this is never going to work. How do you run the migration in the browser?

### Compile offline migrations

Thankfully I came across a very [helpful post on GitHub](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/2532) by [@daltonkyemiller](https://github.com/daltonkyemiller). They found an undocumented API that where we can take our generated SQL migration and convert it in to the JSON format required to run it against PGlite.

```typescript
// You could execute this standalone script with Bun like so:
// drizzle-kit generate && bun ./src/app/db/compile-migrations.ts

import { readMigrationFiles } from "drizzle-orm/migrator";
import path from "path";

const migrationsFolder = "./src/app/db/migrations";

const migrations = readMigrationFiles({ migrationsFolder });

await Bun.write(
  path.join(process.cwd(), `${migrationsFolder}/migrations.json`),
  JSON.stringify(migrations)
);

console.log("Migrations compiled!");
```

We now have a `migrations.json` file that can be used in the browser.

ðŸš¨ _Unfortunately, as the functions are undocumented, the Drizzle team could break them any point in time. Unfortunately if you want to use Drizzle in the browser then there is no alternative at the time of writing._

### Executing the migration
Setup the migration:

```typescript
/// src/app/db/migrate.ts
import type { MigrationConfig } from "drizzle-orm/migrator";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import migrations from "./migrations/migrations.json";

export async function migrate() {
  // @ts-ignore
  db.dialect.migrate(migrations, db.session, {
    migrationsTable: "drizzle_migrations",
  } satisfies Omit<MigrationConfig, "migrationsFolder">);
}
```

and simply execute the exported `migrate` function, e.g.
```tsx
// root.ts
import { migrate } from "./migrate"

migrate().then(renderApp);
```

I've provided an example repo at the end of this post showing how I executed the migration wrapped in [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) so that a placeholder is shown during initalisation.

# Basic CRUD operations
It's just Drizzle all the way forward now, there's a bunch of [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb), but here's some examples sticking with the TODO theme:

```typescript
/// src/app/db/actions.ts
export async function fetchAllTodos() {
  return db.select().from(todos).orderBy(todos.createdAt);
}

export async function addTodoAction(formData: FormData) {
  const todo: typeof todos.$inferInsert = {
    content: formData.get("content") as string,
  };
  const inserted = await db.insert(todos).values(todo).returning();

  return inserted[0];
}

export async function deleteTodoAction(formData: FormData) {
  const id = parseInt(formData.get("id") as string);
  const deleted = await db.delete(todos).where(eq(todos.id, id)).returning();

  return deleted[0];
}
```

# Getting data in and out
There's a number of options depending on what the use-case is, but I'll describe an approach I took. If you just want test data, you can use [drizzle-seed](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/seed-overview).

## CSV
One option to import data is with a CSV. Given it's running in the browser, you need to be able to obtain the CSV as a blob. This is then mapped to [PGlite's virtual device](https://pglite.dev/docs/api#dev-blob) `/dev/blob`, and then you can just copy the data like you ordinarily would:

```typescript
// example depicting the copying of citizen data from a CSV in to the citizens table.

const csvResponse = await fetch('/smart_city_citizen_activity.csv');
await client.query(`
  COPY citizens(id, age, gender, mode_of_transport)
  FROM '/dev/blob'
  DELIMITER ','
  CSV HEADER;
  `, [], {
  blob: await csvResponse.blob()
})
```

If you're storing your data in IndexedDB then you'll also want to query if the data has already been imported before doing so (to avoid doing so on each load!).

 gotcha 3!! it's broken at time of writing - but maybe not today? check.

you can see the full repo here, with some additioanl things (suspense whilst db loads, REPL... etc)

feel free to discuss here or on linked in thanks.

# TODOS, me only..
- Remind myself & document in this guide why it's important:
    -   driver: "pglite", produces an error without it.... what is it?
    - what's the error when:     exclude: ["@electric-sql/pglite"], is not excluded?
- Run through each step, sanity check I've not missed anything
- Proof read
- Fix links to always open externally - do this across blog...?
