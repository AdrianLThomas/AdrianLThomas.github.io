title: Finding an IC job in 2025
date: "TODO"
description: I'm fortunate to have secured a new role as part of my career break, and now wanted to reflect on my experience and share it with others, as an IC in 2025.
---

I made the decision earlier in the year to take a career break: It's not something I've ever done before (I've always had another job lined up), but knew I wanted some time to spend on myself, some hobbies, and training. Which ultimately meant I'd need to find a new role eventually.

Now that I'm fortunate enough to have secured a new role as part of my career break, I wanted to reflect on my own candidate experience and share it with others, as an IC in 2025. This is all based on my own experience & perceptions, rather than a scientific approach.

_This post isn't about the things I did with my time during the career break: But, I would encourage you to consider a career break yourself! I've had a fantastic time._

# Raw Notes
- Timeline
    - Took a couple of months to find something right for me
    - Whilst my plan was to take some time out, I should have started to apply a few weeks earlier - as it can take several weeks for the initial response / screening
    - It's fairly typical to have 4-6 interview stages with a week apart
        - Leet code and/or live pairing seems to be fairly rampant
        - Take home tests are still a thing - but much less common
        - System design is fairly common
        - Behavioural interview fairly common
- Preamble: this is my experience, could well be different for others
    - This was almost like a full time job for me, particularly as I usually had a number of companies on the go at once.
    - all anecdotal rather than any scientific approach. Just sharing my perspective.
- The hunt
    - Understanding what you want
        - subjective, for me products + services I already use and love
        - but not always, there are smaller businesses and startups out there you've not heard of. good to understand what you're really looking for in a company (for me: ambitious, high trust, end to end ownership, great engineering culture)
    - Where to find a job?
        - Network + referrals
        - LI premium
        - HN - I've seen this but not tried it
        - LI job alerts, kind of handy but a lot of noise
            - LI job alerts were useful (e.g. this is where I heard about the K6 role!), and obviously it's a useful platform in terms of networking (new and old connections)
            - However LI premium is not worth paying for. The analytics are interesting, and it's worth the free trial (and perhaps even the discounted one), but the full price is just not worth the money.
                - The AI tools aren't giving you anything above copy & pasting to chatgpt anyway, and obviously you don't want to take the AI content verbatim as it just comes across as fake anyway
    - Remote Working
    - Types of the companies hiring
    - On applying
        - fill in the fields they ask for. I found more success writing a personalised cover letter, and answering any specific questions during that process 
            - my assumption is your name lands on a spreadsheet, this if you're filling in more columns of the row you're more likely to stand out as it shows you've put in more effort too
    - On AI use
        - I did use it for brainstorming during the application process. My CV remained static and factual for all my applications, but if I had the opportunity to write a cover letter it seemed to work better for responses if I could tailor it to the job spec. I'm not suggesting throwing the job spec and your CV at AI to write the letter, but it's not a bad starting point to prompt for some key talking points.. write it out in your own words, with it's own quirks and personalize it.
- OK your application has been accepted, now what?
    - The process
        - Each step but also leet code
        - Use of AI
            - In the interviews
            - Tech tests
    - Preparing for each stage
        - Guidance not always offered, but generally: xyz
        - Tech tests
            - Expectations are high. 
            - Honesty expected within a certain timebox
                - Difficult to gauge the right approach
                - Some expect an excellent, finished, production ready product within 3 hours
                - Others expect the best you can do in that time, and not perfect. Enabling further in depth conversations at the next stage
- Ongoing..
    - Keep hope
        - Some rejections are inevitable. It's not a reflection on you necessarily, it's just not the right fit. It's got to be mutual, and you wouldn't want to work somewhere you didn't feel like you could have impact, would you?
        - Try to have a few things on the go at once... at least if you get knocked back by one, you have others to focus on... plus the process and response times of various companies are different anyway
