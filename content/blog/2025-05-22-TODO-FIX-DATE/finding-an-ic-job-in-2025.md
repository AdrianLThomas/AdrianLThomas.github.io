title: Finding an IC job in 2025
date: "TODO"
description: I'm fortunate to have secured a new role as part of my career break, and I wanted to reflect on my experience and share it with others, as an IC in 2025.
---

I made the decision earlier in the year to take a career break: It's not something I've ever done before (I've always had another job lined up), but knew I wanted some time to spend on myself, some hobbies, and training. Which ultimately meant I'd need to find a new role eventually.

Now that I'm fortunate enough to have secured a new role as part of my career break, I wanted to reflect on my own experience and share it with others, as an IC in 2025. 

_This is all based on my own experience & perceptions, rather than any scientific approach. Also, this post isn't about the things I did with my time during the career break: But, I would encourage you to consider a career break yourself! I've had a fantastic time._

# Defining What I Wanted
Logically, it makes sense to start with this step. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't necessarily clear until I started the process. As part of preparing for upcoming interviews, I looked back at my strengths and achievements that enabled me to really hone in on what inspired me.

However, I did identify a bunch of areas as part of this prepatory process (that were initially just my gut feeling), thus becoming clearer that I wanted somewhere that:
- I was passionate about the product
- I could have ownership
- I could have impact
- Had technical challenges
- Had a strong engineering culture
- Was remote first (with occasional team visits)

I'd encourage anyone in a similar position to try and define this upfront if you can - I think it would have saved me some time during the application process.

# Timeline Expectations
My initial plan was to take ~2 months out - so my thoughts were if I took a few weeks out without even starting the process: no problem.

The reality is that it took several weeks from the point of applying (even in the case of referrals) to get to the screening stage; so in retrospect I'd have definitely started this sooner.

Once the ball was rolling, expect 4-6 stages with a week in-between. Even in a best case scenario that puts you in the ~2 month range straight away.

Some organizations I worked with with were happy to fast track their process (e.g. bundle interviews to the same day or week) to keep up with other orgs and remain competitive, so it didn't seem to be a hard rule either.

Once the interviews started to come through, it almost immediately turned in to a full time job: from having nothing on, to several at once - all requiring their own preparation!

In the end, the position I accepted took exactly 2 months from referral to offer - something for future me to remember!

# Where To Find A Job
I personally heavily relied on LinkedIn: not only for new connections but to keep in touch with old colleagues. When I posted about my [career break](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adrianthomas_opentowork-activity-7303071720263831553-DGcZ) I had a number of folk reach out to me whom I'd worked with over the years, and also a number who offered to refer me at their companies. If it wasn't for the power of LI I'd have almost certainly missed out on these.

It also allowed me to reach out to those who I hadn't spoken to in some time and gauge whether there were any openings.

Job alerts on LI were also handy. There was lots of noise, but a number of applications I made and interviewed for were ultimately ones I would have otherwise being unaware of.

## LI Premium

I also gave LI Premium a go (first month was free, then went up to around ~Â£15, then ~Â£30+ after ðŸ˜±): I personally don't think it's worth paying for. 

The insights are interesting, particularly to get an understanding how a company is growing and in which areas - but some intentionally paywalled features (like seeing all the people who creeped your profile) I cared less about.

The AI tools are not that helpful (beyond copying + pasting it straight in to free ChatGPT). Anything that was automatically written came across as AI, and the button to see "Am I suitable for this job?" was just a bit lazy (it told me I was suitable for things I definitely wasn't, and vice versa).

## Types Of Companies Hiring

<!-- 
    Quite a few startups
    Some scaleups
    Larger orgs too

    A number of AI companies: though the impression I got with these were they were less interested in people with understanding of fundamentals, and more in knowing their current tech stack inside out.

 -->


<!-- Networking and referrals.


<!-- - Types of the companies hiring -->

<!-- - Where to find a job?
    - Network + referrals
    - LI premium
    - HN - I've seen this but not tried it
    - LI job alerts, kind of handy but a lot of noise
        - LI job alerts were useful (e.g. this is where I heard about the K6 role!), and obviously it's a useful platform in terms of networking (new and old connections)
        - However LI premium is not worth paying for. The analytics are interesting, and it's worth the free trial (and perhaps even the discounted one), but the full price is just not worth the money.
            - The AI tools aren't giving you anything above copy & pasting to chatgpt anyway, and obviously you don't want to take the AI content verbatim as it just comes across as fake anyway -->

# The Application Process
<!-- Personalizing applications and cover letters.
Filling in all requested fields.
Using AI for brainstorming, but always personalizing. -->


<!-- - On applying
        - fill in the fields they ask for. I found more success writing a personalised cover letter, and answering any specific questions during that process 
            - my assumption is your name lands on a spreadsheet, this if you're filling in more columns of the row you're more likely to stand out as it shows you've put in more effort too
    - On AI use
        - I did use it for brainstorming during the application process. My CV remained static and factual for all my applications, but if I had the opportunity to write a cover letter it seemed to work better for responses if I could tailor it to the job spec. I'm not suggesting throwing the job spec and your CV at AI to write the letter, but it's not a bad starting point to prompt for some key talking points.. write it out in your own words, with it's own quirks and personalize it. -->

# Interview Stages
<!-- 

Expectations for tech tests and honesty about time spent. -->

The stages were typically: screening, experience deep dive, take home test, test review + improvements discussion, system design and behavioural. Some orgs had less stages, but typically encompassed multiple criteria in a single interview. Also some didn't have take home tests but opted for instead leet code and/or live pairing.

| Stage                | Typical Duration | Notes                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------            |
| Application          | 1-3 weeks       | Waiting for responses                               |
| Screening Call       | 1 week          | Initial chat with recruiter or manager              |
| Experience Deep Dive | 1 week          | Technical/role-specific questions                   |
| Take Home Test       | 1-2 weeks       | Sometimes replaced by leet code / pair programming  |
| Test Review          | 1 week          | Discuss solution & improvements                     |
| System Design        | 1 week          | High-level technical interview                      |
| Behavioural          | 1 week          | Culture fit, values, teamwork                       |
| Offer                | -               | -                                                   |

# Throughout The Process
<!-- keeping multiple opportunities open.
 -->

<!-- 
- Ongoing..
    - Keep hope
        - Some rejections are inevitable. It's not a reflection on you necessarily, it's just not the right fit. It's got to be mutual, and you wouldn't want to work somewhere you didn't feel like you could have impact, would you?
        - Try to have a few things on the go at once... at least if you get knocked back by one, you have others to focus on... plus the process and response times of various companies are different anyway -->
