Well, it's been nearly [5 years](https://adrianlucathomas.blogspot.com/) since I last wrote any kind of personal blog. I've written several posts for employers (a few pieces on NodeJS, Golang, GitHub Actions, etc.), but I finally got my act together and put something under my own domain. I've been writing lots of React lately, and also Gatsby in my own time - so it felt like a good idea to start off with the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/).

I introduced [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and put something basic together (that I plan to improve over time).

I'm going to use this platform for trying out some new tooling (maybe take a look at the [issues here](https://github.com/AdrianLThomas/AdrianLThomas.github.io/issues) for a sneek peak), but I'll also write about my hobbies (see the header!).

Also, because I'm a proper Yorkshireman - this blog runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free, with the DNS & CDN managed at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for free. I build this blog on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for... free. I suppose I do pay a few quid a year for the domain...

That's all for now!
